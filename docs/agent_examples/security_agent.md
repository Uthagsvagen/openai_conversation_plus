# Security Monitoring Agent Example

## Overview
This agent continuously monitors security events, motion detection, door/window sensors, and other security-related activities to provide automated responses and alerts.

## Agent Configuration

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Security Monitor Agent"
  type: "monitoring"
  enabled: true
  schedule: "continuous"
  priority: "critical"
  
  description: |
    Monitors security events and provides automated responses.
    Detects unusual activity and responds accordingly.
    Manages security system states and notifications.
```
