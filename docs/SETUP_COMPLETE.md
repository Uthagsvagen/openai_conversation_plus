# Setup Complete - Extended OpenAI Conversation

The Extended OpenAI Conversation integration has been successfully updated with all requested features and a complete testing environment.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Response API Migration ✅
- Integrated OpenAI's new Response API with backward compatibility
- Added configuration toggle to switch between APIs
- Implemented web search capabilities with `web_search_preview` tool
- Added conversation persistence with `previous_response_id` support

### 2. GPT-5 Model Support ✅
- Added support for GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-5-pro models
- Implemented reasoning level configuration (minimal/low/medium/high)
- Added verbosity control (terse/balanced/expansive)

### 3. Web Search Integration ✅
- Native web search capability through Response API
- Configurable search context size
- User location support for geo-aware searches
- Automatic citation inclusion in responses

### 4. AI Task Platform ✅
- Created `entity.py` base class for LLM entities
- Implemented `ai_task.py` for structured data generation
- Support for attachments (images and text)
- JSON schema validation for structured outputs

### 5. Additional Features ✅
- Streaming support for Chat Completions API
- Enhanced configuration options in config flow
- Preserved custom function functionality from UI

### 6. Testing Environment ✅
- Complete pytest setup with `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`
- Unit tests for all major components
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- Test runner script (`run_tests.py`) for background testing
- Makefile for common development tasks

## How to use:

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Option 1: Use the test runner
python3 run_tests.py

# Option 2: Use make
make test

# Option 3: Direct pytest
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest -v
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to code
2. Run `make format` to auto-format
3. Run `make validate-all` to check everything
4. Commit changes

### Background Testing
The test runner is currently running in the background:
- Output is logged to `test_output_python3.log`
- Tests will run automatically
- Check progress with: `tail -f test_output_python3.log`

## Git Repository
The repository is ready for pushing:
- All changes are committed
- Remote origin is configured (if accessible)
- Use `git push origin main` when ready

## Custom Functions Preserved
The integration maintains the ability to define custom functions through the Home Assistant UI configuration, ensuring backward compatibility with existing setups.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor test results in the background
2. Push to GitHub when ready
3. Test in a Home Assistant instance
4. Submit to HACS if desired

The environment is fully set up for continuous development without needing to run Home Assistant Core!
